Game Goal
===
- Protect & escort some wild animals into a safe place.
- end of the world from left to right. rush to the right. infinite exploration.
- Sleeping ibex in the map! go to wake & rescue them! (population increase, reason to go down)

TODO
===
- Fix hell trigger position
- Polish game progressive difficulty: volcano propagation increase? hell zone speed increase?

- Polish: More variety in the design & events
  - season / weather? (rain, thunder)
  - day & night (different styles, illumination?)
  - general after effect (subtle lighting gradient from the middle)
  - More variety in generated terrains? (lot of air / lot of earth / a bit more forest)
    - To create more diversity: add a difference between "Forest" and "Mushroom": forest grows with water, mushroom grows by itself. if mushroom+water or mushrrom+forest -> become forest (forest spread in mushroom)

- Polish: Make sure animals are safe at spawn
- MOBILE support???
- when left disappear make it blurred?
