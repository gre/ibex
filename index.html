  <p>
  Welcome to the beta-test of the game IBEX.
  This game is my entry for JS13K.
  </p>

    </li>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Protect and escort a group of wild ibex.
    </li>
    <li>
      The world is ending, you need to progress to the right.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is sleeping ibex to rescue, you will have to go deep to rescue them but be careful with the environnement!
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The Gameplay</h2>

  <p>
    You are in god mode and you have to use the 4 elements (Air, Earth, Fire, Water) to make your animals progress safely.
  </p>

  <p>Two ways of playing the game:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
    Keyboard-only: <br>
    SPACE to draw an element, W/Z + X + C + V to switch between Air + Earth + Fire + Water.
    </li>
    <li>
    Mouse-only: <br>
    DRAG on the center cursor to draw. switch between elements with the mouse wheel (or clicking on the elements in the UI).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="beta">PLAY and TEST the Game</a></h2>

  <h2>Known issues</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      There is a know lag when you progress and when the map is re-generated. This won't be fixed.
    </li>
  </ul>
